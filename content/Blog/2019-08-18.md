title: I Am Starting a Blog

I am certainly not expecting anyone to read it however. This is more for me - to keep my thoughts in order, and to help me keep my personal projects on track. I am really good at getting a project 90% complete, but once I learn the things I was setting out to learn and solve the main problem, I tend to move on.

The idea of saying a thing is "finished" is always nerve wracking - it somehow implies it is the best you can do, and it is easy to fall prey to perfectionism. At the end of a project, there is always a part you wish you could redo.

So, I am trying to clean up a couple of older projects to a presentable state, and keep myself accountable to finish new ones.

### Old  Projects to Clean Up
- zigbee/arduino weather station: this one is __really__ old. Need to get some parts 3d printed.
- grump: done! Just need to add it to this website
- dat-mirror - I need to re-write this now that the dat community has settled on a dat daemon. And rebuild the front end.
- futureottawa. This one is on hold for now: I had no idea what I was doing making a front end app. Now I have a better one, so I do want to take a look at this again. Might be an "after graduation" thing.
- java grader - basically done. Need to write some JavaDocs

### New Projects
- Radio Scanner: this is also a bigger one, need to take some time to learn more about it!
- Secure-Dat: this is going to be my honours project, so stuck with it now.
