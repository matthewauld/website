<h2>About Me</h2>

        <hr class="after">

<p>Growing up, I had always had an interest in computers, but it wasn't until just after I had started my first job after graduating from the University of Guelph (B.A. in Political Science and Economics) that I really realized how much I loved programming programming. It started of building access databases, which lead to SQL, then Python, deb development, c++, wireless mesh networks... I was hooked.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I worked a number of jobs in the non-profit sector including fundraiser, marketing coordinator, data analyst, and volunteered disaster response and logistics. But, in 2017, I finally took the plunge and left my full time job to go back to school to study computer science at Carleton.</p>
<p>People often ask me what kind of job I want when I graduate. To be completely honest, I could see myself getting involved in a myriad of fields. I love the critical thinking, mathematics, and problem solving involved in security. I enjoy the creativity involved in developing a well thought-out program. I am fascinated by the possibilities and challenges in decentralized wireless networks. I mostly want a challenge, I want to learn, and I want to build.</p>
