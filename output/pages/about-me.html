<h2>About Me</h2>

    <hr class="after">
<p>Growing up, I had always had an interest in computers, but it wasn't until just after I had started my first job after graduating from the University of Guelph (B.A. in Political Science and Economics) that I really realized how interested I was in programming, strangely through building Access databases. That lead to learning SQL, then python, css and html, c++, web server, wireless mesh networks. I was hooked on learning how to program in as many different languages as I could.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I worked a number of jobs in the Non-Profit sector including philanthropy, marketing coordinator, data analyst, and disaster response and logistics volunteer. But, in 2017, I finally took the plunge and left my full time job to go back to school to study Computer Science.</p>
<p>People often ask me what kind of job I want when I graduate. To be completely honest, I could see myself getting involved in a myriad of fields. I love the critical thinking, mathematics, and problem solving involved in security. I enjoy the creativity involved in developing a well thought-out class extraction. I am fascinated by the possibilities and challenges in decentralized wireless networks. I mostly want a challenge, I want to learn, and I want to build.</p>
