Sometimes, you just need a website. Nothing fancy - you just need to share some files, or post some basic info. There are tons of static site generators out there (this site is build with once of theme - [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html#)), and they work great - but you need to set up config files.

Sometimes, you just need a website to share some files. Or list some information. You may want a bit of css styling or a script, but you don't need anything fancy.

Grump is for you. Just call `grump <directory>` and you are done.

## Grump does three things

1. For every file with a `<name>.md` suffix it generates an html file called `<name>.html`.

2.  For every visible directory (doesn't start with `.` or doesn't match a pattern passed with with `--ignore`). It generates an `index.html` file with a menu with a `menu`(see below) and a list of files and sites that directory contains.

3. The one little bit of magic - Grump will replace `{{MENU}}` with a  file tree of all the visible directories and .html files in a `<nav>` element made of nested lists. Nothing too fancy.

## Scripts and css
Grump will look for `style.css` and `script.js` files in the top of the directory, and will add them to the top of every website it generates.

## Usage
Grump does have some simple options:

```USAGE:
    grump [OPTIONS] [target]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -i, --ignore <ignore>    Patterns to ignore [default: ]
    -j, --js <js>            Javascript file to include
    -s, --style <style>      css file to include

ARGS:
    <target>    Target directory [default: .]
  ```

Tested on linux and mac.

## Grump plays well with everything.
Grump is so simple that any static site server will work. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` works fine for local servers.
Also is a great way to share files via the [Dat Protocol](https://dat.foundation/) and [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/)

## More to come?
Honestly, this project was a good way to learn rust, however, in the name of completeness, there are a few things I wouldn't mind adding at some point:
- Default CSS and JS files, just something simple.
- a `grump scrub` to remove files grump creates. all generate files start with `<!--grump-->` So this wouldn't be too hard.
- A better menu setup - maybe with some default styling.
